# Enhancing Urban Traffic Flow with Branching Dueling Q-Network Adaptive Signal Control

This repository contains an implementation of the Branching Dueling Q-Network (BDQ) for traffic signal control in a SUMO simulation environment. BDQ is designed to scale linearly with the number of action dimensions, avoiding the exponential growth seen in traditional Q-learning methods.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- numpy==2.0.2
- torch==2.6.0
